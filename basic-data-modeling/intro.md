Data modeling is the process of identifying the entities in our domain, the relationships between these entities and how they will be stored in the database.
In this lab you'll learn some important terms such as Keyspace, Table, Column, Row, Primary Key, Partition Key, Compound Key, and Clustering Key. You'll run different CQL queries to better understand those terms and get some hands-on experience with a live cluster.
