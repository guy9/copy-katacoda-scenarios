Finally, let's summarize what we learned in this lab. 


## Summary
These are the main points we covered:

* Scylla data modeling is query-based. We think of the application workflow and the queries early on in the data model process.
* A Keyspace is a top-level container that stores tables
* A Table is how Scylla stores data and can be thought of as a set of rows and columns
* The Primary Key is composed of the Partition Key and Clustering Key
* One of our goals in data modeling is even data distribution. For that, we need to select a partition key correctly
* Selecting the Primary Key is very important and has a significant impact on query performance

The data modeling process is iterative. Itâ€™s an ongoing process:
