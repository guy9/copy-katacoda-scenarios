In the previous step we saw that with CL = QUORUM, and one node down, the read and write were successful. What will happen with CL = ALL? 

## Read and Write Data 


Set the Consistency Level to ALL and try to read and write data:

CONSISTENCY ALL 

insert into users (user_id, fname, lname) values (10, 'vm', 'varga');  

select * from users; 

Both read and write fail. CL = ALL requires that we read/write to three nodes (based on RF = 3), but only two nodes are up.
